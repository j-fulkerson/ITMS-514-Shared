# Final Project Instruction

**The final project is to investigate a data set using all the tools we learn in class. Your project should include the following three parts.**

- [ ]`Data Preparation: Show the information of the dataset. *E.g.# of observations, # of attributes, data types, missing values, etc.*`

- [ ]`Data Exploration(EDA): Data Visualization, at least one histogram, one boxplot, and one overlay histogram with your conclusion`

- [ ]`Data Analysis Hypothesis Testing: Construct a hypothesis testing with null and alternative hypotheses. Use the appropriate test to get the conclusion. Build a linear regression model with subset selection. *Please indicate all significant attributes, assess your model, and predict in a test dataset*.`
